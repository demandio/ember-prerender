# Ember Prerender #

This project allows [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) (and likely other)
web applications to be prerendered on the server using [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
and either [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/) or
[JSDOM](https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom) based on your preference.

The goal of the project is to couple server-side rendering more closely
with a specific web app framework. By utilizing a long-lived instance of
an app rather than reloading it on every request, rendering times can be 
reduced.

The concept and plugin code is based loosely off of the [Prerender
Service](https://github.com/collectiveip/prerender) by Todd Hooper.

## Usage ##

Install ember-prerender:

    $ sudo npm install -g zipfworks/ember-prerender

Copy or edit the default configuration file (in /config/) to match your
app's environment.

Run the service with the path to your configuration file:

    $ ember-prerender config/default.js

If you're invoking node directly:

    $ export CONFIG="config/default.js"
    $ node server.js

## Ember Prerender Event ##

In order for ember-prerender to know that your pages are fully rendered,
your application must emit the prerenderReady event whenever each of your routes
finishes rendering their templates.

Example configuration (CoffeeScript):

Add to: app/initialize.coffee
```CoffeeScript
# Prerender event
prerenderEvent = document.createEvent('Event')
prerenderEvent.initEvent('prerenderReady', true, true)
App.prerenderReady = ->
  console.log('PRERENDER READY')
  document.dispatchEvent(prerenderEvent)
```

In your routes (as of Ember 1.4):
```CoffeeScript
  # Promise hook for when a page has loaded, can be overridden in subclasses
  willComplete: -> Em.RSVP.resolve()

  actions:
    didTransition: ->
      promises = []
      for handler in @router.router.currentHandlerInfos
        if handler.handler.willComplete
          promises.push handler.handler.willComplete()
      Ember.RSVP.all(promises).then App.prerenderReady
```
Instead of adding this to each of your routes, you can extend Ember.Route to
create a base route or use Ember.Route.reopen to change the default behavior.

Depending on your app, you may need to postpone firing the prerenderReady event
by overriding willTransition. You can do so by returning a deferred promise
and resolving it after the other parts of the page have loaded.

To detect whether your app is being loaded in a browser or through prerender,
you can check the window.isPrerender variable which is set to true by
ember-prerender.

## Reloading ##

If your web application changes, you can send a SIGUSR2 signal to the
master prerender process to cause the page to be reloaded.

## Supervisor ##

You may use supervisord to start, stop, restart, and monitor
ember-prerencer. The following is an example configuration file which
should be placed in /etc/supervisor/conf.d/:

```
[program:prerender-yourappname]
command = ember-prerender /mnt/ebs1/www/yourappname/conf/prerender.js
directory = /mnt/ebs1/www/yourappname
user = yourappname
autostart = true
autorestart = true
stdout_logfile = /mnt/ebs1/www/yourappname/logs/prerender.log
stderr_logfile = /mnt/ebs1/www/yourappname/logs/prerender.error.log
```

## Web Server Setup ##

Once Ember Prerender is working with your project, you'll probably
want to enable prerendering for certain user agents (e.g. web crawlers)
while serving Javascript for compatible browsers. One way to do this
is by setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy (below).

### Nginx Reverse Proxy Setup ###

Example configuration (you can add additional instances to the upstream
backend:

```Nginx
upstream prerender-yourappname-backend {
  server localhost:3000;
  #server localhost:3001;
  #server localhost:3002;
  #server localhost:3003;
}

server {
  listen 80;
  listen [::]:80;
  server_name yourserver.com;
 
  root /path/to/your/htdocs;
 
  error_page 404 /404.html
  index index.html;
 
  location ~ /\. {
    deny all;
  }
 
  location / {
    try_files $uri @prerender;
  }
 
  location @prerender {
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    #proxy_intercept_errors on;
 
    set $prerender 0;
    if ($http_user_agent ~* "googlebot|yahoo|bingbot|baiduspider|yandex|yeti|yodaobot|gigabot|ia_archiver|facebookexternalhit|twitterbot|developers\.google\.com") {
      set $prerender 1;
    }
    if ($args ~ "_escaped_fragment_|prerender=1") {
      set $prerender 1;
    }
    if ($http_user_agent ~ "Prerender") {
      set $prerender 0;
    }

    if ($prerender = 1) {
      proxy_pass http://prerender-yourappname-backend;
      proxy_next_upstream error timeout;
    }
    if ($prerender = 0) {
      rewrite .* /index.html break;
    }
  }
}
```
